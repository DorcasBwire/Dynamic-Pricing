**Dynamic Pricing**


Dynamic pricing entails adjusting product or service prices based on different factors in real-time. This ensures businesses are able to optimize their revenue and profitability by setting flexible prices in response to customer behavior, market demand and competitor pricing. 
The goal of dynamic pricing is to leverage data-driven insights and algorithms, such that businesses modify prices to attain the most favorable outcomes. The project involves a hail-riding company operating in the Metropolitan area. The company seeks to maximize its revenue and improve customer satisfaction. Initially, the company utilized ride duration for deciding the ride fares. 

**Project Overview**
This project implements a data-driven dynamic pricing model for a hail-riding company. Moving beyond a static, duration-based pricing structure, the system aims to dynamically adjust ride fares to maximize revenue and enhance customer satisfaction by considering real-time variables.

**Problem Statement**
The initial pricing strategy, solely based on ride duration, fails to account for crucial factors that influence demand, supply, and customer willingness to pay. This leads to missed revenue opportunities during peak demand and potential customer dissatisfaction during off-peak times or when external factors like weather impact ride availability.

**Objectives**
Develop a Predictive Model: Create a machine learning model capable of predicting optimal ride prices based on various influencing factors.
Maximize Revenue: Implement a pricing strategy that dynamically adjusts fares to capture maximum revenue, especially during periods of high demand.
Improve Customer Satisfaction: Balance revenue optimization with customer satisfaction by ensuring fair pricing and potentially incentivizing rides during off-peak hours.
Integrate Real-time Factors: Incorporate dynamic variables such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, event occurrences, and competitor pricing into the pricing algorithm.

**Methodology**
The project employs a supervised machine learning approach to predict optimal prices. The general methodology includes:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the provided CSV datasets and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, relationships, and identify potential features.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data (e.g., extracting hour, day, month from timestamps; categorizing locations; incorporating weather patterns).
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Model Selection and Training: Training a regression model to predict optimal prices based on the engineered features. The notebook snippet shows imports for StandardScaler and train_test_split, indicating a standard machine learning pipeline.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error for regression) and visualizing predictions against actuals (as seen with the plotly scatter plot).
Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Developing a strategy to apply the model's predictions in a real-time scenario, potentially adjusting prices based on predicted demand elasticity.

**Technologies Used**

Python: The core programming language for data manipulation, modeling, and application development.
Pandas: For data loading, manipulation, and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model building, including data splitting (train_test_split) and scaling (StandardScaler).
Plotly: For interactive data visualization, as demonstrated by the newplot.png and scatter plot generation in the notebook.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development, experimentation, and presenting findings.
